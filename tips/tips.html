                    <p><img class="aligncenter" title="Non-Stick-Skillet" src="./img/tips3.jpg" /></noscript></p>
                    <p>Non-stick skillets are essential for frying greens or scrambling eggs, as the ingredients don’t
                        stick to the pan, and they’re pretty easy to clean. These <a
                            href="https://www.searanchlodge.com/best-comal-for-tortillas/" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener">pans are usually very lightweight</a> and with a ceramic coating that helps
                        the pan be more stable and balanced.</p>
                    <p>Make sure not to buy non-stick pans that have PFOAs, a type of chemical that’s been proven to be
                        harmful to your health and environment when used for a long time.</p>
                    <h3>4. Kitchen Shears</h3>
                    <p><img class="aligncenter" title="Kitchen-Shears" src="./img/tips4.jpg" /></noscript></p>
                    <p>These are the most common and basic kitchen tools that you’ll need. Kitchen shears are used for a
                        multitude of reasons, from <a href="https://www.searanchlodge.com/best-meat-slicer-for-bacon/"
                            target="_blank" rel="noopener">cutting meat</a> and vegetables to open plastic packaging.
                    </p>
                    <p>Kitchen shears are mostly used to cut up herbs, trim excess fat from meat, and even break apart a
                        whole chicken. Shears are one of the most multifaceted tools to invest in the kitchen tools
                        list.</p>

                            rel="noopener">cleaning process</a>. And this tool will handle both perishable and
                        non-perishable in the kitchen.</p>
                    <h3>5. Cast-Iron Skillet</h3>

                    <img src="./img/tips5.jpg">
                    <p>Cast-iron Skillets are the most multifaceted <a style="outline: none;"
                            href="https://www.searanchlodge.com/best-hot-plate-for-cast-iron-skillet/" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener">tools to cook or bake</a> with, as it retains high temperatures for a long
                        time, and it can also evenly distribute the heat when it’s set in the oven.</p>
                    <p>You can use this for both baking and roasting since it can be used on both the stovetop and the
                        oven. It gives a gorgeous even sear to any roast scallops or streak.</p>
                    <p>These skillets usually have thick sides and bottoms, which makes them last for decades. And these
                        are also the perfect pans to make peach cobblers and cornbreads.</p>
                    <p>It’s best to know how to maintain a cast-iron skillet; there are several important rules you
                        should follow to make sure the skillet retains its flavor for as long as possible.</p>
                    <h3>6. Whisk</h3>
                    <img src="./img/tips6.jpg">
                    <p>It’s best to choose a medium-size metal whisk to take care of most recipes that require whisking.
                        A whisk should fit comfortably in your hand and feel balanced when you’re applying it for a long
                        while.</p>
                    <p>A proper whisk is the most important tool in mixing dry or wet ingredients during baking or even
                        emulsifying a mixture. If you use the whisk often while cooking, it’s also best to invest in a
                        flat whisk as well.</p>
                    <h3>7. Colander</h3>
                    <img src="./img/tips7.jpg">
                    <p>A ceramic or a metal colander is much sturdier than plastic ones. Used mostly to drain pasta and
                        noodles, the colander also has several other uses in the kitchen.</p>
                    <p>Washing fruits and vegetables become much easier and hygienic with a colander at your disposal.
                        Although it doesn’t have a multitude of purposes like a lot of other kitchen tools in this list,
                        it’s certainly essential.</p>
                    <h3>8. Cutting Board</h3>
                    <img src="./img/tips8.jpg">
                    <p>Having a <a href="https://www.searanchlodge.com/best-cutting-board-oil/" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener">cutting board in your kitchen</a> is just as essential as having knives at
                        your disposal.</p>
                    <p>A cutting board is not only important to keep your knives sharp and help you evenly cut your
                        produce, but it also helps keep your ingredients fresh and away from any germs that you would
                        collect from other surfaces.</p>
                    <h3>9. Saucepans</h3>
                    <img src="./img/tips9.jpg">
                    <p>Saucepans are perfect for cooking in large batches, usually pasta or different stews. You can
                        simmer and boil in large quantities, which is perfect for family meals.</p>
                    <p>And you can also invest in smaller saucepans, which will come in handy when you’re planning to
                        make oats or even make individual dishes.</p>
                    <h3>10. Sheet Pan</h3>
                    <img src="./img/tips10.jpg">
                    <p><a style="outline: none;" href="https://www.searanchlodge.com/best-brownie-pan/" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener">Sheet pans are perfect for baking cookies</a> or roasting wrapped salmon or
                        chicken. It’s best for foods that tend to stick to the pan, making it harder to clean.</p>
                    <p>So if you plan on <a
                            href="https://www.searanchlodge.com/best-over-the-range-microwave-convection-oven-combo/"
                            target="_blank" rel="noopener">using the oven </a>quite often, it’s best to get yourself a
                        sheet pan for easy cleanup.</p>
                    <h3>11. Box Grater</h3>

                        almost any produce and on any surface in minutes.</p>

                            rel="noopener">butter</a>.</p>
                    <h3>12. Tongs</h3>
                    <img src="./img/tips12.jpg">
